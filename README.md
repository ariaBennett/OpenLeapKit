OpenLeapKit
===============

A collaborative tool kit for the Leap Motion device.

Current Features:
- draws simple hands for 2D interaction (using various optional settings).
- detects whether a hand is right or left (simplistic technique of detecting shortest finger over a sampling period predominantly on right or left).
- translates vector information to a confined 2D (x,y) view using InteractionBox, with option to trim the InteractionBox.

Intended Features:
- draw 3D hand/fingers with option to confine to 2D surface (for screen interaction)
- Rig 3D mesh to hand/fingers
- advanced detection of right/left hands
- advanced detection of thumb
- diverse gestures and interactions
- ideas?
